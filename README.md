A reimagination of a "childhood" project called Zombit. 
A text based RPG made with PHP. 
This reimagination uses more up to date workflows, and knowledge. 
Made in a customized microframework. 
Using RedBeans as an ORM. Implementing custom routing and solving modern Framework issues by myself. 

A passion project.
